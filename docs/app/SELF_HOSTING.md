# Self Hosting

## Prerequisites
Before getting started with the project, ensure that you have the following tools and dependencies installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - Docker is used to containerize the application.

## Preparing the Environment

Clone the repository with git and navigate to the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dynbox/{{PROJECT_NAME}}.git
cd {{PROJECT_NAME}}
```
## Running
Run all containers using the following command:
```
docker-compose up
```

This command will start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. If the Docker images for the services are not built yet, Docker Compose will build them for you.
